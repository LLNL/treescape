# Treescape

Treescape is a Jupyter-based visualization tool for performance data, enabling
users to programmatically render graphs. With Treescape, you can load an
ensemble of [Caliper](https://github.com/LLNL/caliper) performance files and
visualize the collective performance of an application across many runs. This
could involve tracking performance changes over time, comparing the performance
achieved by different users, running scaling studies across time, etc.
Treescape is the replacement for SPOT, which was web-based.
